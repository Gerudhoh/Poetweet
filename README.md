# Poetweet

## To Run:

### Recommended (But optional) step: Install Tweepy

- This is because the script that fetches tweets relies on tweepy
- If you *really* don't want to install this there are some tweets provided in /resources

```
$ sudo pip install tweepy
```

### To run the first two user stories by the first actor, type the command:

```
gradlew runPoetweet
```

(If you didn't install tweepy you can't do user story 1 (menu option 1))

But you CAN make a haiku with the following twitter handles:

- dog_feelings
- ProBirdRights
- realDonalTrump

### And for the last user story by the second actor, type the command:

```
gradlew runPoetweetAdmin
```
